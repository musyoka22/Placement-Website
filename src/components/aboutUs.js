        The MOUNT KENYA UNIVERSITY , THIKA (MKU THIKA), is part of a broader initiative by the 
        Kenyan government to establish 100 similar institutions in partnership with private 
        entities, following a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. MKU THIKA enrolled its 
        inaugural class of B. Tech. students in Information Technology, starting from the academic
         year 2015-16, with an initial intake of 50 students.
        This institution presently provides a wide range of academic and non-academic facilities to
         its students, designed to nurture their talents and prepare them to contribute to the nation's 
         technological advancements. The admission process at MKU IT  is conducted through central counseling,
          where candidates who have successfully passed the Kenyan equivalent of the C+ are eligible to apply.
        In essence, MKU THIKA, from a Kenyan perspective, would be seen as one of the 20 institutions established by 
        the Kenyan government in collaboration with private partners to promote technology education. It commenced 
        operations in 2015-16, admitting its first cohort of 50 students in the field of Information Technology.
       The institution offers comprehensive academic and extracurricular support to its students, aiming to 
       empower them to contribute to Kenya's technological progress.
